### A Create React App Project

#### To-Do:
* Check store.js at the export default. I may need to set the object to a 
    variable first
* Change the rest of the CSS in the app to styled-components
* Fix the styling on the Google sign-in button
* Make the titles for the collections in collection preview links, to go to the 
    single collection page
* Fix the @media queries in global styles (padding) and menu item styles
