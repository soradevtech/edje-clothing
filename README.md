# 3DG3-Clothing
### A React E-commerce Project

* The `dev` script runs the project for development

* You'll have to create and insert your own publishable key 
    and private keys with your own Stripe account

* This app has both an Express backend for the Stripe payments as
    well as a client folder that contains the actual frontend

* Remember to replace the config variable in your firebase.utils.js 
    with your own config object from the firebase dashboard    

* This can only be run locally unless you create your own firebase database. 
    If remote, be sure to add the address in the firebase console under
    auth/sign-in method/authorized addresses
    * Will post the DB structure soon
