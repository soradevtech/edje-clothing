#### To-Do:
* Migrate the to-dos in my course notes to here
* Check store.js at the export default. I may need to set the object to a 
    variable first
* Change the rest of the CSS in the app to styled-components
* Fix the styling on the Google sign-in button
* Make the titles for the collections in collection preview links, to go to the 
    single collection page
* Delete the old scss files
* Check the image property in the StripeCheckout component in 
    the stripe button component
* Find a place to host my images
* Take a look into why compression breaks the site after 
    making it pwa compliant
